    summary: |
      My PhD research intends to use both the traditional analytical methods of social evolution theory and novel methods to improve understanding of the major transitions in evolution. This will include examining some of the obstacles in realising the major transitions, i.e., complex adaptation, and mathematically formalising some of the dynamics surrounding the shifts to higher levels of selection mathematically, i.e., a loss of individuality and group adaptation.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing a PhD in social evolution theory at the University of St Andrews. My research interests include the evolution of extreme cooperation, internal conflict, and complexity, especially in the context of the major transitions in individuality. To investigate these interests, I utilize various theoretical and mathematical modelling techniques, primarily in Mathematica and R.
