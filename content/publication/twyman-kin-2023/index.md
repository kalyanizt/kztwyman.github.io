abstract: 'A basic mechanism of kin selection is limited dispersal, whereby individuals
  remain close to their place of origin such that even indiscriminate social interaction
  tends to modify the fitness of genealogical kin. Accordingly, the causes and consequences
  of dispersal have received an enormous amount of attention in the social evolution
  literature. This work has focused on dispersal of individuals in space, yet similar
  logic should apply to dispersal of individuals in time (e.g. dormancy). We investigate
  how kin selection drives the evolution of dormancy and how dormancy modulates the
  evolution of altruism. We recover dormancy analogues of key results that have previously
  been given for dispersal, showing that: (1) kin selection favours dormancy as a
  means of relaxing competition between relatives; (2) when individuals may adjust
  their dormancy behaviour to local density, they are favoured to do so, resulting
  in greater dormancy in high-density neighbourhoods and a concomitant ‘constant non-dormant
  principle’; (3) when dormancy is constrained to be independent of density, there
  is no relationship between the rate of dormancy and the evolutionary potential for
  altruism; and (4) when dormancy is able to evolve in a density-dependent manner,
  a greater potential for altruism is expected in populations with lower dormancy.'
